# Framework #

PPM is built on [Grails](http://grails.org) 0.4.2.

Quoting the Grails website, "Grails aims to bring the "coding by convention" paradigm to  Groovy . It's an open-source web application framework that leverages  the Groovy language  and complements Java Web development. You can use Grails as a standalone development environment that hides all configuration details or integrate your Java business logic.
Grails aims to make development as simple as possible and hence should appeal to a wide range of developers not just those from the Java community.".
