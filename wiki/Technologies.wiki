PPM is built on [http://grails.org Grails] 0.4.2. 

Quoting the Grails website, "Grails aims to bring the "coding by convention" paradigm to  Groovy . It's an open-source web application framework that leverages  the Groovy language  and complements Java Web development.

Grails aims to make development as simple as possible and hence should appeal to a wide range of developers not just those from the Java community.".
